# UFOs Analysis

## Overview

The main purpose of this project/analysis is to gather data from different UFO encounters in the US and demonstrate the data on one, easy-to-navigate webpage. We were able to develop this webpage with the use of html, Javascript, and css. 

## Our Results

We made our webpage very to easy to navigate through, demonstrating all the different UFO sightings in the USA through a simple table on the right. On the left of the page, the user has the ability to filter through the table by date, city, state, country, or even shape. Below is the image of the website:

## Summary

One drawback of the webpage is the fact that all the data is manually store/updated and there is no feature that allows for live updates. For example, if a UFO sighting were to occur overnight, the website wouldn't gain that knowledge right away. It would have to be manually updated with all the filtered information.

### Recommendations for Future Development

1: Implement live data functionalities 

2: Add a comment section for users to interact with one another, which would result in an increase of site visits.
